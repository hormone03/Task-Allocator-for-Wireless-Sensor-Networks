# Task-Allocator-for-Wireless-Sensor-Networks

## Project Description

The idea of this work is to integrate the security guarantee with the task allocation to optimize the energy consumption while fulfilling the security requirements. As GA is popular in optimization problems for the easy implementation and high probability of finding an optimal solution, we propose an intelligent security aware task allocation algorithm (SATA) based on GA for multihop wireless networks.
