# Task-Allocator-for-Wireless-Sensor-Networks
[Project Demo](https://taskallocatorsoftware.herokuapp.com/)
## Project Description
The idea of this project is to develop security awared task allocation (SATA) algorithm based on a genetic algorithm (GA). Firstly, a directed acyclic graph is used to model the task allocation scheme and defines the dependencies relationship between the tasks. Secondly, the algorithm-task-mapper randomly generate an initial set of solutions called population, with each member of the population corresponding to the list of nodes assigned to each task. Finally, the SATA algorithm optimizes the randomly generated solutions to evolve the best solution, using GA, which consist of five basic stages: initial population, fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation. This work also models a novel cost function which comprises of the security cost, communication and computation costs.
